<!--We can think of the internet as a network of computers which send and receive information. Computers need an HTTP request to know how to communicate. The HTTP request instructs the receiving computer how to handle the incoming information. More information can be found in our article about HTTP requests.

The <form> element is a great tool for collecting information, but then we need to send that information somewhere else for processing. We need to supply the <form> element with both the location of where the <form>â€˜s information goes and what HTTP request to make. Take a look at the sample <form> below:-->
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Rubik" rel="stylesheet">
        <title>HTML Forms</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <section id="overlay">
        <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/web-101/unit-6/htmlcss1-img_burger-logo.svg" alt="Davie's Burgers Logo" id="logo">
        <hr>
        <!--Add your code below-->
        <form action="/practice.html" method="post">
            <h1>BORGER</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Davie's Burgers, place of the BORGER</p>
        </form>
