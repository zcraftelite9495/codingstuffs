                <h3>Backstory</h3>
                <p>In a distant and futuristic world, where technology and nature coexisted in a delicate balance, there was a unique Protogen named Z. Unlike most Protogens, Z was a Skull Dog, a rare breed characterized by the fusion of organic and technological components. The only visible piece of technology on Z was his visor, seamlessly embedded into his outlying skull, giving him a distinctive appearance that set him apart from others.</p>
                <p>Z's unusual existence began within the confines of the PWCO (Protogen/Primagen Weapons Creation Organization), a secretive facility that specialized in creating enhanced Protogens for various purposes. Z's creators, driven by greed, sought to sell him to a Dwarvish Tribe known as "Ungar Uziki." The tribe had a reputation for utilizing advanced technology in their rituals and ceremonies, and Z was seen as a prized asset.</p>
                <p>However, Z was not destined to be a mere tool for the tribe. With a combination of determination and clever thinking, he managed to escape from the clutches of the PWCO. Fleeing from the facility, he found refuge in the dense, ancient forest that surrounded the facility. In the forest, he was annoyed by the amount of furs that would judge him for his impulsivity. He would explore the forest constantly, going on missions from time to time and living life like it was a video game.</p>
                <p>One day, as he was wandering through the dense undergrowth, he stumbled upon an unusual sight; a young otter-cat hybrid named Asher. Asher, with his distinctive light pink fur and white belly, was sitting by the edge of a tranquil stream, lost in thought. Z was immediately drawn to Asher's presence, sensing a shared sense of being different from the world around them. He could see the emotional struggles in Asher's eyes, much like the ones he had faced in his own past.</p>
                <p>Approaching Asher with a friendly and genuine demeanor, Z extended a paw of friendship. He saw something special in Asher that others had overlooked, a unique and resilient spirit that deserved to be nurtured. Z's unwavering support and empathetic understanding began to chip away at the emotional barriers that Asher had built over the years.</p>
                <p>Their friendship evolved, and they found solace in each other's company. Z became a source of positivity and hope for Asher, helping him see that he was not alone in the world and that his differences were what made him special. Their bond grew stronger as they shared their dreams, fears, and aspirations, serving as pillars of support in each other's lives.</p>
                <p>As time passed, their deep and affectionate friendship blossomed into a profound love. Z and Asher, two individuals who had faced challenges and adversity, decided to take their relationship to the next level. They chose to be inseparable and share their lives, just like the cuddles they shared during their early days of friendship. Their love story became a testament to the healing power of genuine love and acceptance, providing each other with strength to weather life's storms together.</p>

                <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                <p>Z is a Protogen furry, resembling SCP-1472 (Mal0). They have a sleek, dark-grey fur that exudes an air of mystery. Their most striking feature is a skull with an integrated visor, which projects their emotions and eyes onto its screen, replacing traditional facial expressions. Adding to their mystique, Z bears a distinctive bite mark on their right neck, a haunting reminder of a vampire encounter. But what truly sets them apart is their rare gift of reality-bending abilities, allowing them to manipulate the world around them.</p>
