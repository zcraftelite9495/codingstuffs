# Lesson 2 - Variables

## Learn

### Variables

In programming, a variable is a container for a value. You can think of [variables](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/variables) as little containers for information that live in a computer’s memory. Information stored in variables, such as a username, account number, or even personalized greeting can then be found in memory.

Variables also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.

In short, variables label and store data in memory. There are only a few things you can do with variables:

1. Create a variable with a descriptive name.
2. Store or update information stored in a variable.
3. Reference or “get” information stored in a variable.

It is important to distinguish that variables are not values; they contain values and represent them with a name. Observe the diagram with the colored boxes. Each box represents variables; the values are represented by the content, and the name is represented with the label.

In this lesson, we will cover how to use the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords to create variables.
