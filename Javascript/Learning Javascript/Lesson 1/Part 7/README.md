## Learn

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. All [data types](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/javascript/data-types) have access to specific properties that are passed down to each instance. For example, every string instance has a property called `length` that stores the number of characters in that string. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

```js
console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5

```

The `.` is another operator! We call it the *dot operator*. 

In the example above, the value saved to the `length` property is retrieved from the instance of the string, `'Hello'`. The program prints ~ to the console, because `Hello` has five characters in it.

## Instructions

1. Use the `.length` property to log the number of characters in the following string to the console: <br><br>`'Teaching the world how to code'`
