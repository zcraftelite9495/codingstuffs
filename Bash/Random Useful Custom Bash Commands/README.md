# Random Useful Bash Commands

## What is this section of my repo for?
This section contains exactly what you would think. A bunch of random useful bash commands that I made using linux to help me complete everyday tasks. 

## List of bash commands
- [commit](./commit): Runs several git commands to select all my files in the repo, add them to the changelist, and then commit and push the changes
- [hello-world](./hello-world): Just prints "Hello World" to your terminal, was my very first custom command
- [outside](./outside): Runs the command after it outside of the terminal
