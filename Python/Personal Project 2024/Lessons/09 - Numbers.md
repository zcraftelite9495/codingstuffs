# Numbers
## Learn
Variables can also hold numeric values. The simplest kind of number in Python is the integer, which is a whole number with no decimal point:
```
int1 = 1
int2 = 10
int3 = -5
```
A number with a decimal point is called a *float*. You can define floats with numbers after the decimal point or by just including a decimal point at the end:
```
float1 = 1.0
float2 = 10.
float3 = -5.5
```
You can also define a float using scientific notation, with e indicating the power of 10:
```
# this evaluates to 150:
float4 = 1.5e2 
```
## Instructions
1. You are going shopping. Let’s make a grocery list so that you can plan your budget. Store the number of cucumbers you want to buy in a variable called ```cucumbers```. Make sure it’s at least ```1```, and that it’s the appropriate datatype! The store doesn’t sell partial cucumbers.
2. Each cucumber costs 3.25 doubloons. Store the price per cucumber in a variable called ```price_per_cucumber```.
