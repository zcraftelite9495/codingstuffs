# Booleans
## Learn
Sometimes we have a need for variables that are either true or false. This datatype, which can only ever take one of two values, is called a boolean. In Python, we define booleans using the keywords ```True``` and ```False```:
```
a = True
b = False
```
A boolean is actually a special case of an integer. A value of ```True``` corresponds to an integer value of ```1```, and will behave the same. A value of ```False``` corresponds to an integer value of ```0```.
## Instructions
1. Someone has introduced themselves to you using comments in **script.py**.
Read the comments and then create a variable called ```age_is_12``` and set it to be ```True``` or ```False``` depending on if this person’s age is 12.
2. Create a variable called ```name_is_maria``` and set it to be ```True``` or ```False``` depending on if this person’s name is Maria.
