# Learning Comments
## Learn
Ironically, the first thing weâ€™re going to do is show how to tell a computer to ignore a part of a program. Text written in a program but not run by the computer is called a comment. Python interprets anything after a # as a comment.

Comments can:

* Provide context for why something is written the way it is:
```
# This variable will be used to count the number of times anyone tweets the word persnickety
persnickety_count = 0
```
* Help other people reading the code understand it faster:
```
# This code will calculate the likelihood that it will rain tomorrow
complicated_rain_calculation_for_tomorrow()
```
* Ignore a line of code and see how a program will run without it:
```
# useful_value = old_sloppy_code()
useful_value = new_clean_code()
```
## Instructions
1. Documentation is an important step in programming. Write a comment describing the first program you want to write!
