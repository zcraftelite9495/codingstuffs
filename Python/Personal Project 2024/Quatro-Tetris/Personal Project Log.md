* Started Personal Project Log
* The Learning Curve for 'pygame' is extrememely hard. Right now I am following along with the RealPython guide to help me learn it
* Currently I am trying to figure out why I am getting a type error when I run my example pygame program
* I was able to figure out the TypeError was caused by me not capitalizing a letter. Beatuiful.
* BEHOLD I HAVE CODED A WHITE SQUARE, IN LIKE 800 LINES OF CODE
* Alright, I found a problem in the executable in which it doesnt properly detect the pygame version, so I am fixing it
