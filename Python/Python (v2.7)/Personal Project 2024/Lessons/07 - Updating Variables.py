## Original Code
# -------------------------------------------------------
# january_to_june_rainfall = 1.93 + 0.71 + 3.53 + 3.41 + 3.69 + 4.50
# annual_rainfall = january_to_june_rainfall

# july_rainfall = 1.05
# annual_rainfall += july_rainfall

# august_rainfall = 4.91
# annual_rainfall += august_rainfall

# september_rainfall = 5.16
# october_rainfall = 7.20
# november_rainfall = 5.06
# december_rainfall = 4.06

## My Fixed Code
# -------------------------------------------------------
january_to_june_rainfall = 1.93 + 0.71 + 3.53 + 3.41 + 3.69 + 4.50
annual_rainfall = january_to_june_rainfall

# The += & -= commands are used here to add and remove an amount from a numerical variable
# July Rainfall
july_rainfall = 1.05
annual_rainfall += july_rainfall

# August Rainfall
august_rainfall = 4.91
annual_rainfall += august_rainfall

# September Rainfall
september_rainfall = 5.16
annual_rainfall += september_rainfall

# October Rainfall
october_rainfall = 7.20
annual_rainfall += october_rainfall

# November Rainfall
november_rainfall = 5.06
annual_rainfall += november_rainfall

# December Rainfall
december_rainfall = 4.06
annual_rainfall += december_rainfall
