# So we will start with the amount of cucumbers I would like to buy
# 69 cucumbers sounds pretty good rn
cucumbers = 69

# I cant label a numberical value Doubloons, but ill go ahead and add the numnber
price_per_cucumber = 3.25

# Alright, now we calculate the total, which is gonna make me more broke than I already am
total_cost = cucumbers * price_per_cucumber

# And now lets see the breathtakingly expensive situation I just got myself into
print(total_cost)
print("Doubloons")
