# Escaping characters
## Learn
There are some characters that cause problems. For example:
```
'There's a snake in my boot!'
```
This code breaks because Python thinks the apostrophe in ```'There's'``` ends the string. We can use the backslash to fix the problem, like this:
```
'There\'s a snake in my boot!'
```
