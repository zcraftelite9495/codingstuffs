## Learn
Great! So far we’ve looked at:

* Print statements
* How to create, modify, and use variables
* Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication
* How to use comments to make your code easy to understand
* Different data types, including strings, ints, floats, and booleans
* Converting between data types

## Instructions
1. Let’s apply all of the concepts you have learned one more time!
Create a variable called ```skill_completed``` and set it equal to the string ```"Python Syntax"```.
2. Create a variable called ```exercises_completed``` and set it equal to ```13```. Create another variable called ```points_per_exercise``` and set it equal to ```5```.
