# Print Statements

## Learn

There are two different Python versions. Both Python 2 and Python 3 are used throughout the globe. The most significant difference between the two is how you write a `print` statement. In Python 3, `print` has parentheses.

```
print("Hello World!")
print("Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.")
```

In this course we will be using Python 2. If you go on to write Python 3 it will be useful to note this key difference.

## Instructions

1. Print something using Python 3â€™s syntax.
