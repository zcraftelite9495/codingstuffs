# Forget what I said earlier about me being broke, because apparently I have become rich as hell and came back with 100 cucumbers to split with myself and my 5 roomates
# Lets define the amount of cucumbers I now have:
cucumbers = 100
# And now we can list the amount of people; 6:
num_people = 6

# Alright now we can split these cucumbers amongst us:
whole_cucumbers_per_person = cucumbers / num_people
# And now find out how fat each of us will become
print(whole_cucumbers_per_person)
print("cucumbers per person")

# Alright, I dont wanna waste these leftover pieces of cucumber, lets make it a float
float_cucumbers_per_person = float(cucumbers) / num_people
# As well as doing that, I could have also change the cucumbers and/or the num_people variables to be decimals, yet that would alter the earlier code'
# Now lets see how many extra pieces we will get
print(float_cucumbers_per_person)
print("fully split up cucumbers per person")
